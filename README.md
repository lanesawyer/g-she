The Ginormous Stackrank of Human Experience is a site built with the purpose of discovering the best and worst of human experiences.

## Technologies ##

### AngularJS ###
AngularJS is a "Superheroic JavaScript MVW Framework". It makes development very fast and easy.

### Firebase ###
Firebase is a realtime app platform that allows you to store and sync data instantly. It is a NoSQL database and is great for fast development.

### Angularfire ###
AngularFire is the officially supported AngularJS binding for Firebase. The combination of Angular and Firebase provides a three-way data binding between HTML, JavaScript, and your Firebase backend.

## Running the Development Server ##
For development purposes, we use a very simple Node.js server.

Just navigate to the project directory and run the command:

`node server.js`

## Deploying to Firebase ##

Get Firebase Tools:

`npm install -g firebase-tools`

Run the deploy command:

`firebase deploy`

## Quick Note Regarding Codebase ##
The codebase is currently rather messy. My coding style is to first make it work and then refactor it into something better. As such, new developers joining the project may feel a little disoriented upon examining the codebase, which will always be in some sort of disrepair. If you have any questions, please shoot me an email or create an issue so we can talk about the code design.
